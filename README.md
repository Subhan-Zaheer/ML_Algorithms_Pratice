# Machine Learning Algorithms Practice

Machine Learning is much practicing field all over the world. Here are some Machine learning Algorthims' code. Keep in mind it's not a
project but it's just a practice code. You can find these Algorithms on this link : 
(https://github.com/campusx-official/ML-Roadmap-for-2022/blob/main/README.md)

It includes some important Algorithms like : 
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Linear Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. Multinomial Logistic Regression
6. Softmax Regression
7. Support Vector Machine
8. Naive Bayes

Till the date these Algorithms are included in this repo. Many more to come.
